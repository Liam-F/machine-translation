Machine Translation Using Deep Learning
=====================


In this project, I will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently, and it is part of the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) program, from Udacity.  You can check my report <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.
